# YAsAv

This is the complete source code and the build instructions for the note taking application YAsAv.

YAsAv is an application to take notes, based on the idea that everything you have to note is relative to an activity you complete (you had a meeting with someone, you attended to an event, you read a content).

The source code is published under MIT License. 

YAsAv is based on React Native, and we use Redux for the store management.
